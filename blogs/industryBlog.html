            <p>The governing structure in India is made up of three tiers - the central government, the state
                government, and the local self-government. The local self-governments are further divided into urban
                local bodies and rural local bodies. The 73 rd and 74 th amendments to the constitution (1992) give
                recognition and protection to the local self-governments in India. Urban local governments include the
                Municipal corporations (generally for settlements with population &gt; 500,000), Municipal councils
                (generally for settlements with population &gt; 25,000 and &lt; 500,000) and Municipal committees
                (generally for settlements with population &gt; 10,000 and &lt; 25,000). India is getting rapidly
                urbanized,
                and it is expected that the urban local governments will provide the citizens with basic infrastructure
                and services like roads, health care centers, water supply, sanitation, solid waste management,
                maintenance of public property etc. Let us take a look at couple of key issues faced by the urban local
                governments in India and the resulting poor service delivery to the citizens.</p>

                        Indian cities have grown at a rapid pace, but the municipal revenue needed to govern the cities
                        has not
                        grown proportionately. The municipal corporations in India are struggling financially and remain
                        largely
                        dependent on the state government for transfer of funds. While cities contribute to more than
                        60% of
                        India's GDP, the municipal revenue in India is below 1% of the GDP. This value is much higher in
                        other
                        countries (Brazil - 7.4% and South Africa - 6%). Furthermore, more than 35% of this municipal
                        revenue
                        comes from the funds transferred by the state and central governments.

            <p>We have listed a few key reasons for the revenue crunch faced by the municipal corporations in India:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Inefficient property tax collection - Property tax collection is one of the most important
                    source
                    of own revenue for the municipal corporations. Property tax collection in India is much lower
                    than OECD countries due to property undervaluation, incomplete registers, and ineffective
                    administration. Also, there is a large variation in the per capita property tax collected in
                    different cities. However, it has been observed that the property tax collection in Pune,

                    Chennai, and Kolkata along with some other cities has improved significantly according to
                    estimates for the year 2019-20.</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>

            <img src="../images/industry-graphs/propert_tax_collection_per_capita.png" class="img-fluid industy_images"
                alt="Responsive image">
            <br><br>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption test">Per capita property tax collection (Rs) 2017-18 of various
                municipal corporations</figcaption>
            <br><br>
            <ol type="a" start="2">
                <li>Implementation of GST - After the implementation of GST, taxes like octroi &amp; it's variants
                    and
                    advertisement tax were subsumed in GST. This reduced the tax revenue from sources other
                    than property tax.</li>
                <li>
                    Dependence on state governments for funds - The share of state transfers in the total
                    municipal revenue is quite significant. State governments are required to constitute State
                    Finance Commissions (SFCs) every five years. SFCs are expected to spell out the principles to be
                    applied for determining the allocation of funds to local governments and the range of taxes and
                    non-taxes to be devolved to them. However, state governments have not set up SFCs in a
                    regular and timely manner and hence in most of the states, SFCs have not been effective in
                    ensuring rule-based devolution of funds to local governments. The municipal councils and
                    municipal committees are dependent on the state governments for funds to an even greater
                    extent than municipal corporations. It has been observed that the state governments are
                    generally reluctant to grant greater financial independence to the urban local governments.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
            <ol start="2">
                <li><b>Devolution of Power to Urban Local Bodies</b> </li><br>
                <p>12th Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the provisions that specify the powers,
                    authority,
                    and responsibilities of Municipalities. This schedule was added by the 74th Amendment Act of 1992.
                    But, in reality, functions such as fire and rescue services are not even devolved on to the ULBs and
                    many other functions like the maintenance of roads and bridges, electrification and related works,
                    etc.
                    are devolved partially as there are parastatal organizations entrusted with similar duties as of the
                    Municipal corporations. The parastatal organizations mostly report to the state government and the

                    coordination between them, and the municipal corporations is generally poor. This causes poor
                    service
                    delivery and citizen engagement. The number of parastatals is going up as the states show reluctance
                    to devolve various functions to the municipal corporations.</p>
                <br><br>
                <li><b>No Say in Urban Planning</b></li><br>
                <p>Instead of the municipal corporations, state government-controlled development authorities mainly
                    carry out urban planning in most of the major cities of India. These are bureaucratic agencies with
                    no
                    accountability to the urban local government. In absence of proper planning, the municipal services
                    find it difficult to cope with the increasing needs of the population. The administrative machinery
                    of
                    the local bodies is also often insufficient to deal with the increasing population.</p>
                <br><br>
                <li><b>Poor Service Delivery</b></li>
                <br>
                <p>From potholed roads to piles of garbage on the streets and from traffic congestion to poor public
                    health centers, the list of grievances of people living in cities is endless. Insufficient funds,
                    lack of
                    coordination between municipal corporations and parastatals, inefficient administration, political
                    tussle between local &amp; state governments and corruption are some of the reasons which result in
                    poor
                    service delivery to citizens.</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Building and maintenance of urban roads - India boasts of a vast network of urban roads.
                        However, the quality and maintenance of these roads is a huge concern. The pothole ridden
                        roads in Indian cities have been responsible for innumerable accidents, especially during the
                        monsoon season. These roads also need to be repaired with alarming regularity. The situation
                        was aptly described by a union minister who sarcastically remarked - “Maintenance is a subject
                        that makes everyone — politicians to officials and contractors — happy. Frequent maintenance
                        work brings a lot of satisfaction, though the public is the only loser. Contractors get upset
                        when
                        decisions are taken for durable roads as they feel they will lose their business.”</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Solid waste management - The urban solid waste management scenario in India has improved
                        at a rapid pace in the past decade, although a lot still remains to be done. The percentage of
                        urban solid waste treated has risen from 19% in 2015-16 to 50% in 2020-21 while the
                        percentage of urban solid waste landfilled has fallen from 39% in 2015-16 to 18% in 2020-21.
                        The door-to-door collection of waste and its segregation has improved over the years and the
                        number of composting and biogas plants has also gone up. However, there is huge variation in
                        the performance of different states and municipalities when it comes to solid waste
                        management.</li>

            <ol type="a" start="3">
                <li>Public health and education - Municipal corporations across the country also run some schools
                    and health centers for the cities' populace. The municipal schools in India are typically
                    characterized by shortage of teachers, high student to teacher ratio and very poor

                    infrastructure. Public health care centers and hospitals run by the municipalities too face
                    infrastructural shortcomings and acute shortage of medical staff as they cater to a much larger
                    population than what they are designed for. Public health &amp; education remains one of the few
                    areas where there has not been any major improvement over the past decades (barring a few
                    exceptions) and this deprives the urban poor of quality and affordable healthcare &amp;
                    education.
                    Shortage of funds and the ineptitude of officials &amp; local politicians are the major reasons
                    which
                    prevent a large-scale facelift of this sector.</li>

                </li>
                <br><br>
                <li>Cleanliness and sanitation - Indian cities perform very poorly with regards to cleanliness and
                    sanitation when compared with their counterparts in Europe or America. To be fair, in this case,
                    the blame is shared by both the citizens and the urban local governments. However, in the last
                    decade there has been an increased national focus on cleanliness and beautification of cities.
                    According to the Swachh Survekshan 2022 which ranked the urban local bodies (ULBs) based on
                    various cleanliness and sanitation parameters; Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra
                    were the front runners in the &gt; 100 ULBs category while Tripura and Jharkhand were the front
                    runners in the &lt; 100 ULBs category.</li>
