                <li><b>Fragmented Land Holdings</b> - The seemingly abundance of net sown area in 
                    India pales into insignificance when we see that it is divided into small, 
                    scattered and economically unviable holdings. The average size of the land 
                    holdings is decreasing over the years and marginal land holdings accounted 
                    for a 68.5% of the total holdings in 2016.</li>

            <p>(Marginal Land Holdings - Below 1 Hectare, Small Land Holdings - 1-2 Hectares, 
                Semi-Medium Land Holdings - 2-5 Hectares, Medium Land Holdings - 5-10 
                Hectares, Large Land Holdings - Above 10 Hectares)</p>
                <br>
            <li><b>Irrigation</b> - Irrigation is the artificial supply of water to overcome 
                deficiencies in rainfall for crops. Good irrigation coverage is essential in 
                India due to seasonal and uncertain rainfall. It helps to improve food 
                security, reduce dependence on monsoons, improve agricultural 
                productivity, promote crop diversification, and create rural job 
                opportunities.</li>

                    <li>Net Sown Area - The physical extent of land on which crops are sown 
                        and harvested is known as net sown area. </li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Gross Sown Area - The cumulative area sown once or more than once 
                        in a year is the gross sown area. For example, a region is counted 
                        twice in gross sown area when crop is cultivated on the area of land 
                        twice in a year.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Gross Irrigated Area (%) - Gross Irrigated Area is the total area under

            <li><b>Availability of Capital - </b><br><br><p>Agricultural credit is considered as one of the most 
                basic inputs for conducting all agricultural development programs. In India, 
                there is an immense need for proper agricultural credit as most of the 
                farmers are very poor. The main suppliers of money to the farmer were the 
                moneylenders and commission agents who used to charge high rate of 
                interest and purchase the agricultural produce at very low price. However 
                rural credit scenario has undergone a significant change as institutional 
                agencies such as Cooperative Banks, Commercial Banks, Cooperative Credit 
                Agencies, and some Government Agencies are extending loans to farmers on 
                easy terms.</p>
                <p>The ratio of Agricultural Credit outstanding to Agricultural GDP jumped from 
                    0.6% in 1951 to 21.76% in 1988. This was achieved mostly on account of 
                    nationalization of banks and introduction of RRBs which expanded the reach 
                    of formal credit in the country. However, the reverse trend in the ratio 
                    started from 1991 and it fell to 13.34% in 1999. Post 1999 the ratio increased 
                    steeply and reached up to 39.55% in 2007, which indicates that introduction 
                    of Kisan Credit Card was a big booster for agricultural credit. After 2007 the 
                    ratio has risen to 51.56% in 2018.</p>
                    <p>It has been estimated that non-institutional sources of credit (mostly local 
                        moneylenders) were dominant in 1951, accounting for 90% of the 
                        outstanding debt of cultivator households, but their share declined sharply 
                        to 37% in 1981. After 1981, the rate of decline slowed down, and the share 
                        of non-institutional sources was 28% in 2015.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Availability of Fertilizers -  </b>Increase in the consumption of fertilizers is a 
                barometer of agricultural prosperity. However, there are practical difficulties 
                in providing sufficient manures and fertilizers in all parts of India. According 
                to the Impact Study of Soil Health Card Scheme; India consumes about 25.6 
                million tons of fertilizers, mostly Nitrogen (17 million tons) followed by 
                Phosphorous (6 million tons) and Potassium (2.5 million tons). The current 
                NPK ratio is 6.7:2.4:1, which is highly skewed towards Nitrogen as against the 
                ideal ratio of 4:2:1. The variation in fertilizer usage across states is also huge.</li>

            <br><br>
            <p>It has been observed that there is a need for educating farmers for using soil - specific fertilizers. It has also been suspected that the skewed usage of 
                fertilizers is because of inappropriate marketing of certain fertilizers which 
                fetch farmers a higher subsidy.</p>
                <br><br>
            
                <li><b> Inadequate Storage Facilities - </b>As of 2020 the total storage capacity 
                    available with Central and State agencies for storing food grains was 755.94 
                    Lakh Metric Tons; while there were cold storages with a capacity of 374.25 
                    Lakh Metric Tons available for storing perishable produce like fruits and 
                    vegetables (mostly privately owned). However, the storage facilities in the 
                    rural regions of India are mostly inadequate. Due to this, farmers are 
                    compelled to sell their produce immediately after the harvest at low prices.
                    A study by National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) said storage is 
                    the major cause of post-harvest losses for all kinds of food in India, especially 
                    fruits and vegetables. India faces a critical deficiency of cold storage capacity 
                    which belies the potential of the food processing industry. Food Corporation 
                    of India estimated post-harvest losses for all kinds of food in India at around 
                    15%.</li>

                </figcaption>
            <br><br>
            <p>It is expected that use of scientific storage methods, privatization and 
                development of larger and better distributed rural storage infrastructure will 
                help improve the storage capacities and stop wastages.</p>
                <br><br>
                <li><b>Poor Transport Facilities and Lack of Mechanization - </b>Lack of cheap and 
                    efficient means of transportation is a major problem often forcing farmers 
                    to sell their produce in local markets at a significantly lower rate. Also, little 
                    or no use of machines in various agricultural activities like ploughing, sowing, 
                    irrigating, weeding, harvesting, threshing etc. in the case of small and 
                    marginal farmers results in huge wastage of human labor and in low yields.
                    Agricultural implements and machinery are a crucial input for efficient and 
                    timely agricultural operations for increased production.</li>
